                <p>Big Sean is a Rap artist from Detroit.</p>
                <p>Big Sean's music, particularly his album "Dark Sky Paradise," has had a profound impact on my life.
                  I remeber one time when I took a trip to Mexico, and my phone service didn't support service out of the U.S., but
                  luckily I had this album downloaded, so I was kinda forced to listen to it on repeat lol. I appreciate his ability to tell powerful
                  stories through his songs; his music has provided me with a sense of comfort and inspiration during difficult times,
                  and has helped me to overcome personal challenges.
                  My cousin and I have bonded over Big Sean's music in many ways. We both enjoy listening to his albums together, and often discuss the lyrics and meanings of his songs.

                <p>Cyberpunk. A subgenre of science fiction. About futuristic societies where advanced technology and
                  the internet have become ingrained in all aspects of daily life.</p>
                <p>The main thing that draws me into cyberpunk is the blurring of the line between the physical and digital worlds. Which is
                  pretty cool. In the game and TV show, we see characters with augmentations
                  and implants that enhance their physical abilities, although they start to go crazy or go into "Cyberpsychosis"
                  if they abuse the enhancement or it'll just happen long-term, and allow them to access the vast network of information that exists
                  in the cyberworld. I like how the world of cyberpunk is often depicted as being bleak and dystopian, but it also shows us a glimpse
                  of the incredible potential of technology. It raises thought-provoking
                  questions about the role of technology in our lives, and the possible consequences of its continued advancement. Overall, the
                  wonder of cyberpunk lies in its ability to transport us to a future that is both familiar and alien, and to make us think
                  about the implications of our own relationship with technology. It's pretty cool.

                <p>The manga is known for its compelling plot, well-developed characters, and stunning artwork, and has
                  gained a massive following worldwide.Hunter x Hunter features a unique and complex system of combat called "Nen,"
                  which allows practitioners to manipulate their own life energy for various purposes such as offense, defense, and
                  support. The Phantom Troupe, a group of thieves known for their ruthlessness and extraordinary Nen abilities, is a
                  major antagonist in the series. Hisoka, a member of the Troupe and one of the main characters, is a complex and
                  enigmatic individual with a love of battle and a twisted moral code. Hisoka is a fan favorite due to his unpredictable
                  actions and impressive Nen abilities. The creative writing of Togashi, the creator of Hunter x Hunter, is also a
                  major draw of the series. Togashi is known for his intricate and multi-layered plotlines, as well as his deep and
                  well-developed characters. The result is a manga that is consistently engaging and full of surprises. It is widely

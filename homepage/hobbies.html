                in your muscles. I'm on a mission to get jacked and there's no stopping me. Loaded up 225 on the bar and grinded out a few reps.
                It's where I can let go of all my stress and just focus on becoming the biggest, baddest bro in the room. Nothing beats
                the feeling of making gains and seeing your muscles grow. Always trying to get that Dog back. It's a bro thing, you wouldn't understand. Gotta hit the protein
                shakes and get some gains, see ya at the gym! #gains #nevermisslegday #Dogback

                <h6 class="txthobhead"> Berserk </h6>
                <h6 class="txthob">  Berserk is a dark fantasy manga series that follows the story of Guts, a skilled mercenary warrior
                  who is haunted by his past and the demons that plague him. The series explores themes of camaraderie, loss, and the
                  constant struggle against the evil that lurks in the world. Despite facing overwhelming odds, Guts remains determined
                  to fight for his beliefs and protect those he holds dear. The series is known for its graphic violence and intense
                  character development. Its philosophical and psychological elements, and its exploration of the human condition and
                  the nature of good and evil...
                </h6>
                <h6 class="txthob">
                    Berserk has influenced the way I view the world and my own struggles, teaching me to persevere and be true to myself.
                    It is a thought-provoking series that has left a lasting impact on me. Unfortunately, the writer of Berserk,
                    Kentaro Miura, passed away before he was able to complete the story.

                <h6 class="txthobhead2"> StarFox 64 </h6>
                <h6 class="txthob"> StarFox 64 is a classic sci-fi action game released for the Nintendo 64 in 1997. It was revolutionary
                  for its time due to it's plane flying 3rd person POV. You would fly in a space craft shooting other ships and enimies.
                  It was pretty awesome. The game follows a team of anthropomorphic animals (my favorite being Fox the main character) as they defend the galaxy from the evil
                  Andross and his army.
                </h6>
                <h6 class="txthob"> I remember constantly playing this game constantly as a child. I was fascinated by the diverse cast of characters
                  and the different paths to beat the game, adding to its replay value. I enjoyed trying to beat the game using different
                  routes and playing until the sun came up. To this day I place it in my top 5 games... OF ALL TIME!
                </h6>
                <h6 class="txthob"> The game had a lasting impact on me, as it sparked my love for science fiction and fast-paced action games.
                  Overall, StarFox 64 is a timeless classic that holds a special place in my childhood memories.

                <h6 class="txthob"> I have been playing Pokemon throughout my entire life. It has been a constant presence in
                  my gaming journey and has provided endless hours of entertainment and enjoyment.
                </h6>
                <h6 class="txthob"> Pokemon Platinum was my first Pokemon game. I remember getting my first handheld console, a
                  Nintendo DS, and my parents taking my two older brothers and me to Best Buy to choose a handheld console. While
                  my brothers chose the PSP, I stuck to my guns and chose the DS, which had a significant impact on my life. The DS
                  introduced me to a whole new world of gaming and opened up a whole new avenue of entertainment for me. It was a
                  defining moment in my life and one that I will always remember fondly.
